# Preface {.unnumbered}

writing stacks on a slow laptop

## Outline:

-   **Introduction**: Demonstrate a speedup with an applied example â€“ switch modeling engine, evaluate in parallel, adjust search approach, use submodels

-   **Models**: Explore timings to resample various different models

    -   Across models

    -   By model type

    -   Threading

-   **Parallelism**: Sequential vs. forking vs. socket clusters

-   **Search**: Grid search vs. racing vs. iterative

-   **The submodel trick**: Revisit example from introduction and explain the ins and outs

Beyond the basics(?):

-   **Preprocessing**

-   **Sparsity**

-   **GPU Training**

-   **Stacking**
